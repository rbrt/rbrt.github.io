<h5>March 9 2016</h5>

<p>I had a few recent posts about playing with Voronoi Diagrams lately in fullscreen
effects. The results were interesting, and pretty nonsensical. I’m at a point now
in my TOP SECRET project (Which I’ll probably post about after GDC) where I need
to be transitioning between different gameplay scenes. I was thinking that one
neat method of doing this might be to utilize that Voronoi work a little bit.</p>

<p>It isn’t really very hard to do; I’m just sampling an RGB noise texture for my
Voronoi points, and then colouring the cell with whatever the noise texture’s
colour is at the nearest sample point. The source looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/Mar/VoronoiSource.png" /></p>

<p>And the result, which is pretty plain, looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/Mar/VoronoiResult.png" /></p>

<p>But then I decided to add some sine waves, because that’s usually what you do
when you write a fragment shader, and wound up with this:</p>

<p>This was cool and looked more arty than anything I’ve done before lol, but I
thought it would be cool to try and add some texture. So, I then started trying to
colour things by their distance from the center of the cell. My implementation is
naive (read: wrong) but it produced this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/Mar/VoronoiAccident.gif" /></p>

<p>Which I thought was pretty cool. So then I thought, what about if we added more
sines… and some cosines too? I couldn’t get the result to loop cleanly, but I
thought it looked nice anyway so here you go:</p>

<p>Programming shaders is fun! Now maybe I’ll come out of this with something to
actually use in my game…</p>
