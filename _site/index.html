<h5>September 6 2014</h5>

<p>I’ve put in some more work on PK over the last weeks or so, and have been building
systems to help with making content instead of making content. This is the first time
I’ve really put more than a weekend into a side project, and also the first time
on a side project that I’ve really taken the time to design something that will scale.
Usually I just want to hack together something that works, and I think that a big
reason I get discouraged when trying to pick up development again is that my codebase…
well, sucks.</p>

<p>The system I made is a tree for managing combos and special moves. I wound up implementing
this as an actual tree of transforms which gets stored as a prefab. Each transform has
a PlayerAttack component, which holds information like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Animations</li>
  <li>Damage</li>
  <li>Effects (knockback, stun, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>More importantly, it has a list of “next moves”. Each of these moves is associated with
a button press and a timing window, and if input that corresponds to any of these next moves
is fed into the attack tree, then the tree is traversed and that attack is invoked. I also
wound up building some editor tools to help modify and copy the attack tree and to make new
segments. The workflow is straight forward, and once the animations and script for an attack
exist, it’s pretty quick for me to add it to the tree.</p>

<p>This has been pretty fun because I really like making tools and systems, and I have something
that, despite being simple, feels good and like something I want to iterate on and extend. The
downside to spending time on these aspects though is that content-wise, I don’t have much to
show. My plan for the next short while is to spend some time trying to make a short level and
seeing if I have something fun on my hands. If it feels like there’s something there, then
it’s time to start adding background assets and new enemies, then get back to systems and moves.</p>

<p>In closing, here is a jab-jab-cross combo in action:

<h5>August 28 2014</h5>

<p>First things first, I got my DK2 yesterday:
<img src="/images/dk2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Second, I’ve been working on a beat ‘em up when I can find time which is tentatively called
“PK”. 5 points if you can figure out what it stands for. At this point I’ve just done some rough
animations, spent some time figuring out crowd behaviours, and written a loose framework
for enemy AI which is already proving to be poor at scaling. I want to use some of the learnings
I obtained during an AI talk at Unite to help manage this. Here’s a gif of the current state of things:</p>

<p><img src="/images/pk.gif" /></p>

<p>Third, I went to Unite 2014 last week. It was my first time doing a conference, and it was a really
great experience. My main takeaway was a lot of new knowledge, but I also met a few new people and
got to see some friends I hadn’t seen in awhile. The talks were mostly useful, and seemed to fall
on opposite sides of the Awesome&lt;===&gt;Weak spectrum without any falling anywhere in between.
There were some great chats on AI, Multiplatform Development, Editor Scripting and Tool Design,
Compilers and Code Generation, 2D tricks, and Physically Based Rendering. The good talks felt like
being in a university lecture, but while being totally engaged and coming out with immediately useful
knowledge. That experience occurred in university, of course, but was much less frequent.</p>

<p>It was really cool and exciting to see what’s coming up in Unity 5.0, and to hear the features
planned out for beyond 5.0 in the roadmap talk. I also didn’t take advantage of all of the engineers
they had available in between each talk, but knowing about that portion of the conference, I will
definitely be ready to take advantage of it next year. On that note, I’m definitely going next year.
Any doubts I had about the value of conferences were dispelled, and I’ve been motivated to make my
way out to GDC next year, and anything else that looks interesting, as a result.</p>

<h5>August 16 2014</h5>

<p>One day into construction and I’ve got this page in a state I’m happy with. Now I can focus on making
more things to display here! I had some semblance of a page before that I had built with Python using
Django and Bootstrap, with hosting occurring on a droplet with DigitalOcean. Upon deciding to move things
over to Github Pages, I decided to scrap what I had and mostly start again. This page is built with Jekyll
on top of one of the provided themes. I modified a few things and have written a bit of my own CSS, but the
rapid development of this page is in no small part due to the scaffolding provided by GitHub.</p>

<p>Using Jekyll’s templating features feels quite similar to Django’s templates, and I’m glad to not
have to forego those features as a result of moving away from Django. The power of handling everything
behind the scenes with Python scripting is undeniable, but I also don’t really need any of that for
a project like this page. The built-in blog support of Jekyll is great too, and while there are freely
available packages for the Python Django stack that make blogging easy, I’m finding this way of doing
things to be pretty effortless.</p>

<h5>August 15 2014</h5>

<p>Hi there, I’m Rob Butler and this is my site. This is mostly just a test post, so here’s a little about myself. I like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loud Amps</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>The Road Warrior</li>
  <li>Unity</li>
  <li>William Gibson</li>
  <li>Discharge</li>
  <li>Burritos</li>
  <li>Black Clothes</li>
  <li>Bikes</li>
  <li>Starcraft</li>
</ul>

<p>I work as a Software Engineer at Orpheus Interactive in Halifax, NS. I spend my time there making neat things like core systems, gameplay sequences,
graphics, and effects. That pretty accurately describes how I spend a lot of my free time, but when I’m not doing that, I’m playing in
bands in cities around North America. I enjoy getting immersed in other worlds through movies, TV, and reading SciFi.
Biking around my beautiful city and camping just outside it are also lots of fun, but I’d be lying if I tried to paint
myself as an outdoorsy type.</p>

<p>I’ve been working through a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science since 2010. As it’s now 2014, that should probably mean that I’ve already
graduated, but I put courses on the backburner to jump on the opportunity to develop a great game with an amazing team at Orpheus.
I’m still planning on finishing my degree, but I’m managing the program by taking a substantially reduced courseload on top of working full
time. Doing that while playing in bands and being actively social has been quite hectic, but I’m into it.</p>
