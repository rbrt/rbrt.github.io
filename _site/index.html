<h5>December 31 2014</h5>

<p>I really like making tools. The most experience I have with this is in the context
of editor scripting in Unity, but it’s something I’ve been doing whenever it makes
sense. I’ve found that I really enjoy tool development because it’s wonderful to
click a button or run a command and have a tedious process completed quickly and
automatically. But since developing tools for production, I’ve also found another
aspect which I really enjoy: the quick feedback loop.</p>

<p>In my situation, the tools are put into use almost instantly, because they’re
usually developed to solve a problem currently facing the team. Sometimes, the
tools are put into use before they’re even really completed. This leads to a
process where I’m getting feedback on what is and isn’t useful, and what would be
better right away. To contrast this with the other development I do at work, aside
from limited playtesting, we have had no outside eyes on our game, and thus no
feedback. I find it immensely satisfying to know that people are using things I’ve
created, and with tool development, that occurs quickly and often.</p>

<p>Here are some tools I’ve made over the last year that have been fun to implement:</p>

<h4>Automatic Navmesh Generation</h4>

<p>We have a large, streaming world comprised of many scenes. (I want to take a moment to plug
<a href="http://www.sectr.co/">SECTR</a> which has helped out a lot!) Unity has a limitation
(which looks to be addressed in the upcoming Unity 5) that prevents us from streaming
in navmeshes, so the solution is to have one large navmesh. Importing all the relevant
geometry is time consuming, annoying, and frequently causes the poor 32-bit application
to crash. To solve this, I wrote a tool which gradually imports each scene and deletes
everything which will not be included in the navmesh (see: not marked navmesh static).
At every stage of the process, the temporary scene is saved and the import progress is
stored in a scriptable object. This allows us to resume from where we left off in the
event of a crash. Once all of the scene contents have been imported,then the
giant navmesh is baked.</p>

<h5><i>Selecting what to include in Navmesh</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/AutomateNavmeshMenu.png" /></p>

<h5><i>End result</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/BakedNavmesh.png" /></p>

<p>Before having this tool, one of our devs would have to be tied up for the duration of
each import, as well as the final bake. Each manual import of each scene was
essentially a roll of the dice, as it was very likely that Unity would crash (and
more so with each successive scene) especially considering that all GameObjects were
kept around. Deleting all of the non-essential objects helped out considerably.</p>

<p>The only parts of this process that are not automatic are clicking the buttons to
invoke the import and bake, and then reverting all changes (except the new navmesh)
in mercurial. Reverting changes in source control is somewhat heavy handed, but it’s
quick, foolproof, and allows us to do the very destructive operation of deleting
all non-essential objects safely.</p>

<h4>Automatic Creation and Updating of Mecanim Animation State Machines</h4>

<p>We have a great deal of assets whose names are just hashes, and these need to be
associated with animations. We had hoped that we could do something at runtime
using override controllers, but found that in order to play things smoothly, on
demand, and without crashing, we needed to have the relevant animations already
set up in a state machine. To this end, I created a tool to build these large
state machines, which look like this:</p>

<h5><i>I tweeted this on the day of writing the tool</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/AnimationStateMachineTweet.png" /></p>

<p>They are gross to look at (and actually, the states are all on top of eachother.
I spread those out manually for the screenshot) but are basically never used by
a developer directly; all invokation is done by hash reference through code. I
had so much fun with this because I got to use reflection (&lt;3) to get at all of
the underlying functions to construct the state machines. Apparently there is a
much more expansive API for Mecanim in Unity 5 which I haven’t looked into yet,
so reflection might not be necessary going forward.</p>

<p>First, I had to poke around for a bit to see how things work and what was available,
and then I started on generating state machines. Since we don’t need transitions
defined (we just crossfade into animations) this was pretty straightforward, but
fun nonetheless. The tool is able to generate a new layer (so as not to interfere
with the other states on an AnimationController) and also able to update an existing
layer when new animations are added. It took something that would’ve been really
tedious and error prone, and made it into a development step that runs in a few
seconds.</p>

<h4>Automatic Creation of Enemy Encounters</h4>

<p>In my spare time I’ve been working on a 2D beat ‘em up which I’ve written about
before, still tentatively titled PK. Recently, I’ve made the notion of an enemy
encounter. This is an event which is triggered by the player advancing to a certain
point in the world, which results in spawning different types and amounts of enemies,
changing the music, playing a visual cue, etc. The encounters themselves are
implemented as a small hierarchy of GameObjects, with some internal references as
well as references to controllers and instance objects in the scene. While it is
fairly straightforward to set up by hand, I decided to automate the process.</p>

<p>I wrote a small editor script which creates and names the required empty GameObjects,
attaches the required components, and assigns the default references. In this manner
I can set up a new fight relatively quickly and not get bogged down making sure I’ve
done the grunt work properly each time. This took very little time to do, around
30 minutes, and has saved me a fair bit of time already.</p>

<h4>Lists to Dictionary Inspector</h4>

<p>Another deficiency of Unity is that you can’t serialize a dictionary. Because key-value
pairs are wonderful for all sorts of things, this gets annoying. Aside from losing
the ability to easily store key-value pairs, Unity also provides no facilities for
managing a dictionary in the inspector. A quick workaround for the serialization
problem is to use two lists or arrays to hold the keys and values, and then
convert them to and from a dictionary at runtime. I wrote a small custom class that
can be inherited from to make a quick, self-managing pair of lists with dictionary
conversion methods. This still doesn’t provide the key-value representation in the
inspector though, so I wrote a custom inspector to display the list contents as
key value pairs. In this manner, I can now create and manage dictionaries in a fashion
similar to other collections.</p>

<h5>December 15 2014</h5>

<p>Today at the office we had an in house game jam for a day. The team produced
about 10 games in total, many of which were Christmas themed. It was a blast to
take the day and just make something on the office machines. It was also really
cool to see what everyone had come up with at the end of the day. I worked alone
and decided to continue getting mileage out of the rigged baby model I bought
for Catastrophe Jam. The result was Rabies Babies (jam theme was “two words
that rhyme”):</p>

<p><img src="/images/RabiesBabies.gif" /></p>

<p>I need to stop making things with Unity 5 so that I can actually post playable
builds…</p>

<h5>December 12 2014</h5>

<p>The first (and only?) annual Catastrophe Jam is finishing up at Volta tonight.
The rough premise is that you have three hours to make a game, but beyond that,
there aren’t really any rules. There would up being about 30 or 40 people taking
part, which was awesome. We saw a bunch of different submissions which varied
substantially in how far complete they were.</p>

<p>I made Babby’s Quest. A third-person action adventure game. Here are two gifs
from it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/BabbysQuest1.gif" /></p>

<p>It was a ridiculous night.</p>

<h5>December 10 2014</h5>

<p>I’ve been messing around with Blender lately and it’s been hilarious. I decided
that neglecting to have any 3D ability is probably a bad idea, and that it can’t
be that hard to learn. Where I like the idea of things looking really goofy, it
seems that making basic, silly 3D monstrosities should be a fun exercise. So,
without much concern so far for things like UV mapping or worrying about poly
count, I set out to make some stuff.</p>

<p>The first one is… Chuds Bandbox. I can’t
really explain this much more than writing out the title. Who or what is chud?
What is a bandbox? Why did I make this? I don’t know, but me and @mrdanielbrauer
are 100% responsible for it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ChudsBandbox.gif" /></p>

<p>The next thing I made was a dude made out of stretched and extruded primitives
for the Halifax Game Collective’s Cool Kidz jam. I didn’t really complete a game,
but I did make this dude. I made the sunglasses from scratch; definitely a proud
moment…? The only document I have of this on hand is a saved snapchat converted
to a gif, so here it is:</p>

<p><img src="/images/CoolKidzSnapchat.gif" /></p>

<p>I want to play around more with Blender and learn about some intermediate concepts,
as well as maybe make things that aren’t just slightly altered primitive shapes,
but it has still been a blast to mess around with.</p>

<h5>December 9 2014</h5>

<p>So a few weekends ago we went and played Not Dead Yet 2014 in Toronto. It’s the third
(?) iteration of the festival and we played last year as well. It takes place all
over the Downtown area in about 10 venues across 4 days. It was an insane weekend
and, as most big festivals are, a chance to see lots of tour friends from around
the world. I saw some people from the West coast that I hadn’t seen in 2 or 3 years
and that was wonderful. We made and unloaded a bunch of merch, which these dudes
sold for us:</p>

<p><img src="/images/MerchBoyz.jpg" /></p>

<p>Playing was a lot of fun, but even better was the chance to catch some incredible
sets. <a href="http://institute.bandcamp.com/">Institute</a> from Texas have
been my favorite band of the year, with the Salt EP being my favorite record of
the year by far. They did not fail to hold up to expectations live either, it was
so so so good. The other really killer set of the weekend was DiE from the UK:</p>

<p><img src="/images/DieInToronto.jpg" /></p>

<p>They also held up to their recordings, though I caught them in New York in April
so already knew what to expect. My friend Ben broke his rib during their set,
though that was pretty much his own fault.</p>

<p>We stayed in an AirBnB in Kensington market which was huge, nice, cheap, and
close to everything. I’ve stayed in AirBnBs in New York, Seattle, and Toronto and
they’ve all been awesome. Down with hotels, up with AirBnBs. I was disappointed to
not score many records while in Toronto except for a few 7”s, but all in all it was
a great weekend and a nice getaway.</p>
