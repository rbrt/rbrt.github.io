            <h2 id="train-jam-complete">Train Jam Complete</h2>
<h5>February 28 2015</h5>

<p>We got discouraged a few times, we’re way tired and pretty out of it, but we did it.
We barely went outside for three days, travelled through several states, and slept
in reclining chairs in a speeding tin can…. and made this:</p>

<h5><i>Infiniclub</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/Infiniclub.gif" /></p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/allanlavell">Allan</a> and I, despite being really sick
and sleeping terribly for the duration of the jam (although I guess that describes
anyone who wasn;t in a sleeper car) managed to push out a pretty ridiculous game.
We called it Infiniclub, and the pitch is basically that it’s Crypt of the Necrodancer
meets Flappy Bird. We wound up with a playable prototype with standin music and
some very broken mechanics.</p>

<p>I managed to put my recent Blonder skills to good use, making a bunch of dancing
characters and some additional art assets. Everyone was animated in Unity, as I
still haven’t ventured into rigging and animating anything in animation software.
We targeted the iPhone, and have a working build on each of our phones where you
swipe in the direction you want to move, but we also put keyboard controls in place
because swiping with a mouse is a huge pain for testing.</p>

<p>The look of the game came together towards the end of the weekend, but was actually
really straightforward. I put a single rotating directional light with a moderate
intensity and white colour in the scene, and then gave essentially everything in the
game a specular material. I tried to pick base colours and specular colours that would
blend nicely together, and even when it didn’t work the effect was still cool. What
using the specular material bought us was the effect where everything changes colour
in a strobing motion at the same time. It also adds a great deal of variety to the
colour palette in the scene at any given time.</p>

<p>We also put in a pooling system, and used it to define several different types of
object pools. This lets the game go on forever without needing to instantiate a
whole bunch of new GameObjects (expensive!) and keeps things running smoothly. We also
managed to include (per device) persistent high scores which display on the main screen,
and a system of multipliers and gaining points through collectable items during gameplay.</p>

<p>The big glaring thing we weren’t able to get tight was actually enforcing that the player
be interacting with the game to the rhythm of the song. Towards the end of the jam,
we came to the conclusion that Unity’s audio timer (AudioSettings.dspTime) diverges slightly
from it’s in game timer. We tried to rig up some last minute solutions to compensate for
this (literally, in the last 20 minutes) but were unable to get it down perfect. So for Train Jam,
the player can just tap whenever they please and only needs to worry about maintaining
their multiplier.</p>

<p>Some other notable games included a twin stick jouster where you attack by spinning the
sticks in motion together, a two player game of chicken with a train where the train is
totally random and provides no warning, a 4 player kart racer where each player uses
half of a controller to play, and a racing game where the track is revealed only as players
die by flying off of it. It was a really cool experience, an interesting way to travel,
and definitely worth doing. Now we’re all in SF getting ready for GDC tomorrow, staying
at the Mason St Hostel with what seems like everyone else from the train. Here we go.</p>

<h5>February 26 2015</h5>

<p>I’m on a train right now somewhere in Idaho, taking part in my first Train Jam.
Train Jam is this thing where a bunch of devs and artists get on a train in Chicago,
and then ride it to San Francisco. During the trip, a theme is announced and we all
make games. I’m working with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/allanlavell">@allanlavell</a>
on an iPhone game that we haven’t titled yet.</p>

<h5><i>Pictured here: Allan</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/TrainJamGettingStarted.JPG" /></p>

<p>We’re looking to take the gameplay of something like Frogger (or as a more recent
and direct influence, Crossy Road), and merge it with rhythm based gameplay, ala
Crypt Of The Necrodancer. So far we’re prototyped a few mechanics, thrown a few
things out, and have a decent skeleton for moving forward. We should have something
playable by the end of the night, and then we’ll be left with the remaining ~2 days
to polish polish polish.</p>

<p>We don’t have much internet access, so we’re working without much help. Fortunately,
we’ve got all our tools on hand, and we set up an adhoc network to run a git server.
I can connect to Allan’s machine over the network via ssh, and we’re able to use our
usual workflow. Some other devs are sharing a git repo on a USB drive and pushing
pulling to/from that. Constraints force you to get creative.</p>

<h5><i>Git over adhoc network</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/TrainJamWorkflow.png" /></p>

<p>This year Train Jam is seemingly a big deal. There is a booth at GDC where the games
are going to be playable, and some gaming media is going to be giving it some
coverage. There are also a bunch of sponsors, and as a result, all of the snacks
on the train are free. I can’t get over this. I was kind of sleep deprived before
we even got started, I’m probably going to be in brutal shape when we get to SF.</p>

            <h2 id="james-quaternion">James Quaternion</h2>
<h5>February 25 2015</h5>

<p>For the last week and a half I’ve been working on something tentatively titled <i>James Quaternion</i>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionFlightDemo.gif" /></p>

<p>I’m trying to create an aesthetic influenced by Star Fox 64, and the game is
sort of evolving as I implement different effects and mechanics. It’s been fun,
and my first real foray into doing anything in 3D beyond really short game jams.
To get a pixelated effect, I’m pushing the camera to a 256x256 RenderTexture
which is placed in front of an orthographic camera. This gives me a really blocky
screen for free, and should also be nice for adding other fullscreen effects
down the line.</p>

<p>I decided to spend more time in Blender, and have been making almost all of the
assets for the game using it. The water and land are procedurally generated, but
the ships, lasers, explosions, etc. have all been made in Blender. Right now I’m
using a bunch of materials to colour the individual parts of each model, but I want
to provide vertex colour data to the models and get at that in the shader to save
from having so many materials in a scene.</p>

<h5><i>The player's fighter</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionFighter.png" /></p>

<h5><i>An enemy blomp</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionBlomp.png" /></p>

<p>So far, aside from flying around, you can shoot lasers (both charge shots and
regular shots) and launch seeker missiles. I implemented the laser charge by using
a particle system with a negative velocity so that it emits inwards. A parameter
controls the colour of the charge shot, and will also be tied to damage when damage
is programmed. The missiles are kind of cheating as they just have force applied
and use Transform.LookAt to move towards their target, but the effect works well
enough.</p>

<h5><i>Charge shots and seeker missiles</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionLaserMissileDemo.gif" /></p>

<p>I implemented a shield by wrapping the fighter in a low poly sphere and modified
Unity’s transparent shader to produce three ripples based on two offset values.
Whenever the shield gets hit, the shield gets rotated to face the point of impact,
and then a coroutine quickly lerps the two values to produce a shield ripple effect.
I don’t cull the front or back faces, so that you can see the shield ripples all the time.
I also implemented a boost which is pretty straightforward, but I made the boost fire in
Blender and have the engine trails changing colour. I was trying to find a way to
modify Unity’s TrailRenderer Colour array, but it doesn’t seem to be possible without
editor scripting. (The only way I could get this to work was with the method in PGJ’s <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/trail-renderer-colors-c.54162/">post</a>)
This is a bummer because the gradual altering of each element of the array looked a
lot better than affecting the material all at once. Ah well.</p>

<h5><i>Shield and boost</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionShieldDemo.gif" /></p>

<p>Over the weekend, I implemented water as well which was a lot of fun. I decided
to do it using Gerstner waves from this
<a href="http://graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/rendering/2005/jdewall/tessendorf.pdf">paper’s</a>
section on “Practical Ocean Wave Algorithms”. The equation for generating waves involves
summing a series of waves with a few parameters that allow you to affect frequency, amplitude,
direction, and (cool but not used in my case) curl of the wave. A single wave looks
like this:</p>

<h5><i>Gerstner Wave</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/GerstnerWave.png" /></p>

<p>And it generalizes to this:</p>

<h5><i>Summation of Gerstner Waves</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/GerstnerGeneralized.png" /></p>

<p>I implemented that in a vertex shader which gets applied to a flat shaded procedurally
generated plane, which looks like this:</p>

<h5><i>Oooo, water...</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionWaterDemo.gif" /></p>

<p>That is pretty simple and could be accomplished with a much less
involved shader, but whatever, this was fun to write. I really want to be recomputing
face normals on the fly so that the colours change, but I don’t know of any way to do this
without using geometry shaders, which I can’t do in Unity on OSX with an integrated
graphics chip. My assumption here is that I would be able to get information about the
current triangle in the geometry shader, as opposed to trying to figure that out in
a vertex shader which has no knowledge of the other vertices. I might write this on
a windows box or on my iMac at work just to see how it looks. It’s been suggested that
I could pass in the total size of the mesh and vertex count, and then use information about
the vertex in world space to figure out information about each triangle. I may give
this a shot in the near future. Also, if you crank up the poly count and parameter values,
then you get some big rolling waves:</p>

<h5><i>Big ol' waves</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/JamesQuaternionBigWaves.gif" /></p>

<p>I’ve also been working on an effect to distort the area underneath the player. It
works by passing information about the player’s position into the vertex shader, when
the player is flying lower than a certain height. A triangle is projected onto the mesh,
which grows as the player gets closer. Inside this triangle, the waves are distorted
at a different rate than the rest of the waves, sort of making it look like the
engines are pushing the waves aside. I haven’t quite nailed this effect down yet
and it’s especially jarring at the back of the trail, but at present it looks like this:</p>

<p>Anyway, more to come…. at some point!</p>

            <h2 id="fun-with-tool-development">Fun With Tool Development</h2>
<h5>December 31 2014</h5>

<p>I really like making tools. The most experience I have with this is in the context
of editor scripting in Unity, but it’s something I’ve been doing whenever it makes
sense. I’ve found that I really enjoy tool development because it’s wonderful to
click a button or run a command and have a tedious process completed quickly and
automatically. But since developing tools for production, I’ve also found another
aspect which I really enjoy: the quick feedback loop.</p>

<p>In my situation, the tools are put into use almost instantly, because they’re
usually developed to solve a problem currently facing the team. Sometimes, the
tools are put into use before they’re even really completed. This leads to a
process where I’m getting feedback on what is and isn’t useful, and what would be
better right away. To contrast this with the other development I do at work, aside
from limited playtesting, we have had no outside eyes on our game, and thus no
feedback. I find it immensely satisfying to know that people are using things I’ve
created, and with tool development, that occurs quickly and often.</p>

<p>Here are some tools I’ve made over the last year that have been fun to implement:</p>

<h4>Automatic Navmesh Generation</h4>

<p>We have a large, streaming world comprised of many scenes. (I want to take a moment to plug
<a href="http://www.sectr.co/">SECTR</a> which has helped out a lot!) Unity has a limitation
(which looks to be addressed in the upcoming Unity 5) that prevents us from streaming
in navmeshes, so the solution is to have one large navmesh. Importing all the relevant
geometry is time consuming, annoying, and frequently causes the poor 32-bit application
to crash. To solve this, I wrote a tool which gradually imports each scene and deletes
everything which will not be included in the navmesh (see: not marked navmesh static).
At every stage of the process, the temporary scene is saved and the import progress is
stored in a scriptable object. This allows us to resume from where we left off in the
event of a crash. Once all of the scene contents have been imported,then the
giant navmesh is baked.</p>

<h5><i>Selecting what to include in Navmesh</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/AutomateNavmeshMenu.png" /></p>

<h5><i>End result</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/BakedNavmesh.png" /></p>

<p>Before having this tool, one of our devs would have to be tied up for the duration of
each import, as well as the final bake. Each manual import of each scene was
essentially a roll of the dice, as it was very likely that Unity would crash (and
more so with each successive scene) especially considering that all GameObjects were
kept around. Deleting all of the non-essential objects helped out considerably.</p>

<p>The only parts of this process that are not automatic are clicking the buttons to
invoke the import and bake, and then reverting all changes (except the new navmesh)
in mercurial. Reverting changes in source control is somewhat heavy handed, but it’s
quick, foolproof, and allows us to do the very destructive operation of deleting
all non-essential objects safely.</p>

<h4>Automatic Creation and Updating of Mecanim Animation State Machines</h4>

<p>We have a great deal of assets whose names are just hashes, and these need to be
associated with animations. We had hoped that we could do something at runtime
using override controllers, but found that in order to play things smoothly, on
demand, and without crashing, we needed to have the relevant animations already
set up in a state machine. To this end, I created a tool to build these large
state machines, which look like this:</p>

<h5><i>I tweeted this on the day of writing the tool</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/AnimationStateMachineTweet.png" /></p>

<p>They are gross to look at (and actually, the states are all on top of eachother.
I spread those out manually for the screenshot) but are basically never used by
a developer directly; all invokation is done by hash reference through code. I
had so much fun with this because I got to use reflection (&lt;3) to get at all of
the underlying functions to construct the state machines. Apparently there is a
much more expansive API for Mecanim in Unity 5 which I haven’t looked into yet,
so reflection might not be necessary going forward.</p>

<p>First, I had to poke around for a bit to see how things work and what was available,
and then I started on generating state machines. Since we don’t need transitions
defined (we just crossfade into animations) this was pretty straightforward, but
fun nonetheless. The tool is able to generate a new layer (so as not to interfere
with the other states on an AnimationController) and also able to update an existing
layer when new animations are added. It took something that would’ve been really
tedious and error prone, and made it into a development step that runs in a few
seconds.</p>

<h4>Automatic Creation of Enemy Encounters</h4>

<p>In my spare time I’ve been working on a 2D beat ‘em up which I’ve written about
before, still tentatively titled PK. Recently, I’ve made the notion of an enemy
encounter. This is an event which is triggered by the player advancing to a certain
point in the world, which results in spawning different types and amounts of enemies,
changing the music, playing a visual cue, etc. The encounters themselves are
implemented as a small hierarchy of GameObjects, with some internal references as
well as references to controllers and instance objects in the scene. While it is
fairly straightforward to set up by hand, I decided to automate the process.</p>

<p>I wrote a small editor script which creates and names the required empty GameObjects,
attaches the required components, and assigns the default references. In this manner
I can set up a new fight relatively quickly and not get bogged down making sure I’ve
done the grunt work properly each time. This took very little time to do, around
30 minutes, and has saved me a fair bit of time already.</p>

<h5><i>Automation</i></h5>
<p><img src="/images/EnemyEncounterCreator1.png" />
<img src="/images/EnemyEncounterCreator2.png" />
<img src="/images/EnemyEncounterCreator3.png" /></p>

<h4>Lists to Dictionary Inspector</h4>

<p>Another deficiency of Unity is that you can’t serialize a dictionary. Because key-value
pairs are wonderful for all sorts of things, this gets annoying. Aside from losing
the ability to easily store key-value pairs, Unity also provides no facilities for
managing a dictionary in the inspector. A quick workaround for the serialization
problem is to use two lists or arrays to hold the keys and values, and then
convert them to and from a dictionary at runtime. I wrote a small custom class that
can be inherited from to make a quick, self-managing pair of lists with dictionary
conversion methods. This still doesn’t provide the key-value representation in the
inspector though, so I wrote a custom inspector to display the list contents as
key value pairs. In this manner, I can now create and manage dictionaries in a fashion
similar to other collections.</p>

<h5>December 15 2014</h5>

<p>Today at the office we had an in house game jam for a day. The team produced
about 10 games in total, many of which were Christmas themed. It was a blast to
take the day and just make something on the office machines. It was also really
cool to see what everyone had come up with at the end of the day. I worked alone
and decided to continue getting mileage out of the rigged baby model I bought
for Catastrophe Jam. The result was Rabies Babies (jam theme was “two words
that rhyme”):</p>

<p><img src="/images/RabiesBabies.gif" /></p>

<p>I need to stop making things with Unity 5 so that I can actually post playable
builds…</p>
