<h5>January 22 2017</h5>

<p>This weekend I’ve been getting over a pretty rough cold, but I’ve just been
continuing to work on <i>Mountain Drift</i>. For whatever reason, I’ve been
really motivated to keep working on this project, so I decided to keep riding that
momentum.</p>

<p>Originally for my smoke, I was using sphere mesh particles with an additive particle
shader, and this was killing performance all the time. It was fine for a first pass,
but I needed to do something about it. In keeping with the low poly art style, I
hopped into Blonder and made a smoke mesh:</p>

<p>Because this has a decent shape to it, I can use a shader that doesn’t do any alpha
blending. As soon as I made this change to my smoke particles, performance was no
longer a problem. I think I like the resulting effect more too, but this probably
isn’t the final pass.</p>

<p>I also extended the track and added a finish line. At the base of the mountain,
there is the beginnings of a forest. I really want to look into various solutions
for creating nice backgrounds; I’d like to have a distant city, mountain ranges,
or a seemingly infinite forest and none of those are things I’ve tackled before.
For now, this is what the finish line looks like:</p>
