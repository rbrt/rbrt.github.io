<h5>February 2 2017</h5>

<p>I’ve banged out a few more features over the last week or so, the most significant
of which is the ability to use a boost. Initially, the boost worked MarioKart
style - as you drift, your boost becomes more powerful. When you exit the drift,
the boost kicks in. This seemed to work, but was kind of annoying to me. To confirm
that theory, I got a few  people to play the game at our monthly Halifax Game Collective
meetup. Almost everyone went flying off the track when it kicked it, so I decided
to make it something that is activated by the player instead.</p>

<p>Now, as you drift, a boost bar is filled up. When you successfully complete the
drift, the boost is added to your <i>Boost Bar</i>. Once you’ve accumulated boost,
you can activate it at any time. This lets you try to correct a bad drift off
track, gain speed before a drift, keep momentum through a drift, etc. In terms of
implementation, boosting just applies a greater amount of force to the car, and
increases the velocity that the car’s rigidbody is capped at. I experimented for
awhile until finding a value that produced a noticeable amount of speed without
making the car uncontrollable, but I exaggerate it with some camera shake and FOV
changes anyway.</p>

<p>I also added a lap timer, and some more drifting indications. You’ll now see the
current drift’s possible score, current distance, and possible boost. Colliding
into an object, or flying off the track will cancel everything you’ve accumulated
so far. I’ve fixed a few small bugs. Getting some play testing at the meetup was
a really positive experience. Seeing people have fun and want to keep trying was
really motivating, even if no one was able to finish the track…</p>
