<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>Hi there, I’m Rob Butler and this is my site. I work as a Software Engineer at Orpheus Interactive in 
Halifax, NS. I spend my time there making neat things like core systems, gameplay sequences, graphics, and effects.
That pretty accurately describes how I spend a lot of my free time, but when I’m not doing that, I’m playing in
bands in cities around North America, getting immersed in other worlds through movies and TV, or reading Science Fiction.
Biking around my beautiful city and camping just outside it are also lots of fun, but I’d be lying if I tried to paint
myself as an outdoorsy type.</p>

<p>I like loud amps, C#, The Road Warrior, Unity, William Gibson, Discharge, burritos, black clothes, bikes, and Starcraft. </p>
