<h5>December 10 2014</h5>

<p>I’ve been messing around with Blender lately and it’s been hilarious. I decided
that neglecting to have any 3D ability is probably a bad idea, and that it can’t
be that hard to learn. Where I like the idea of things looking really goofy, it
seems that making basic, silly 3D monstrosities should be a fun exercise. So,
without much concern so far for things like UV mapping or worrying about poly
count, I set out to make some stuff.</p>

<p>The first one is… Chuds Bandbox. I can’t
really explain this much more than writing out the title. Who or what is chud?
What is a bandbox? Why did I make this? I don’t know, but me and @mrdanielbrauer
are 100% responsible for it:</p>

<p>The next thing I made was a dude made out of stretched and extruded primitives
for the Halifax Game Collective’s Cool Kidz jam. I didn’t really complete a game,
but I did make this dude. I made the sunglasses from scratch; definitely a proud
moment…? The only document I have of this on hand is a saved snapchat converted
to a gif, so here it is:</p>

<p>I want to play around more with Blender and learn about some intermediate concepts,
as well as maybe make things that aren’t just slightly altered primitive shapes,
but it has still been a blast to mess around with.</p>
