<h5>February 26 2015</h5>

<p>I’m on a train right now somewhere in Idaho, taking part in my first Train Jam.
Train Jam is this thing where a bunch of devs and artists get on a train in Chicago,
and then ride it to San Francisco. During the trip, a theme is announced and we all
make games. I’m working with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/allanlavell">@allanlavell</a>
on an iPhone game that we haven’t titled yet.</p>

<p>We’re looking to take the gameplay of something like Frogger (or as a more recent
and direct influence, Crossy Road), and merge it with rhythm based gameplay, ala
Crypt Of The Necrodancer. So far we’re prototyped a few mechanics, thrown a few
things out, and have a decent skeleton for moving forward. We should have something
playable by the end of the night, and then we’ll be left with the remaining ~2 days
to polish polish polish.</p>

<p>We don’t have much internet access, so we’re working without much help. Fortunately,
we’ve got all our tools on hand, and we set up an adhoc network to run a git server.
I can connect to Allan’s machine over the network via ssh, and we’re able to use our
usual workflow. Some other devs are sharing a git repo on a USB drive and pushing
pulling to/from that. Constraints force you to get creative.</p>

<p>This year Train Jam is seemingly a big deal. There is a booth at GDC where the games
are going to be playable, and some gaming media is going to be giving it some
coverage. There are also a bunch of sponsors, and as a result, all of the snacks
on the train are free. I can’t get over this. I was kind of sleep deprived before
we even got started, I’m probably going to be in brutal shape when we get to SF.</p>
