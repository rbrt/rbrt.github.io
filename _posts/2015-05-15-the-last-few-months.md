I'm terrible at updating this blog. A fair bit has happened since the last time I
wrote an entry. All of GDC for starters. I was actually disappointed with it
compared to Unite. I found that a lot of the talks were really lacking, and some
felt unfinished. There were definitely some worthwhile talks (One on the history
of sidescrolling camera techniques comes to mind) but they were sparse. I could've
made do with only an Independent Games Summit Pass instead of the All Access. Without
that though, I wouldn't have been able to get.... free coffee.

The show floor was cool. I got to play some rad games (Thumper!!) and see lots of
stuff. The sheer spectacle was pretty impressive, and it was neat to see the kind
of thing that, previously, I had just seen in gaming magazines as a kid. I had a few
biz meetings that were alright and got to ask some questions about Unity 5. Some of
the features just aren't that appealing, but I'm not the target audience.

I met a lot of people, went to some really cool parties, found out the dangers of
the open bar, and got to dodge some of the worst winter in a 100 years in Nova Scotia.
it was a good week. Immediately following GDC, I took the subway over to Oakland
and then went on tour with Life Chain for 2 weeks. We started off playing a fest
in Oakland and then went up and down the West Coast.

We were going to go as far north as Vancouver, but had some border issues and didn't
wind up going into Canada. It turns out that the Canadian border can (and will) force
you to give them your phone's password and then they go through everything. All your
photos, emails, facebook messages, texts, etc. It's an invasive process that leaves you
feeling pretty violated. That happened and it was a total bummer.

A few weeks after getting back, I made a shift in my working environment and headed
over to Silverback Games as their Lead Developer. They got me set up with some
sweet gear and put me to work on an upcoming iOS game.

I've been there for about a month and a half now and I've managed to:

    - Cut memory usage on device in half
    - Implement an asynchronous loading pipeline which removed a 10 second load after every level
    - Reduce the overworld's scene size by ~60% with a few tricks to remove serialized data
    - Decompose some pretty heavily tangled code into discrete components

Working here is a lot of fun and the team is small, but rock solid. I'm excited to see where we go!
