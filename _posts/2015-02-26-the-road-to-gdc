I'm on a train right now somewhere in Idaho, taking part in my first Train Jam.
Train Jam is this thing where a bunch of devs and artists get on a train in Chicago,
and then ride it to San Francisco. During the trip, a theme is announced and we all
make games. I'm working with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/allanlavell">@allanlavell</a>
on an iPhone game that we haven't titled yet.

We're looking to take the gameplay of something like Frogger (or as a more recent
and direct influence, Crossy Road), and merge it with rhythm based gameplay, ala
Crypt Of The Necrodancer. So far we're prototyped a few mechanics, thrown a few
things out, and have a decent skeleton for moving forward. We should have something
playable by the end of the night, and then we'll be left with the remaining ~2 days
to polish polish polish.

We don't have much internet access, so we're working without much help. Fortunately,
we've got all our tools on hand, and we set up an adhoc network to run a git server.
I can connect to Allan's machine over the network via ssh, and we're able to use our
usual workflow. Some other devs are sharing a git repo on a USB drive and pushing
pulling to/from that. Constraints force you to get creative.

This year Train Jam is seemingly a big deal. There is a booth at GDC where the games
are going to be playable, and some gaming media is going to be giving it some
coverage. There are also a bunch of sponsors, and as a result, all of the snacks
on the train are free. I can't get over this. I was kind of sleep deprived before
we even got started, I'm probably going to be in brutal shape when we get to SF.
