Wow, it's been a really long time since I've written anything here. That's due
largely in part to the hectic schedule at work lately. We've been working on a
project that, up until now, has been totally under wraps. We're still keeping
most of the details secret, but, I can now talk about the fact that I'm working
on Sons Of Anarchy: The Prospect. It's an episodic first-person adventure game,
and working on it has been a great experience.

We crunched really hard for the latter portion of this year, and definitely had
some intense periods throughout 2014 to make deadlines and seize opportunities.
It's been worth it though, because I've been able to work on so many different
classes of game elements and have learned so much as a result. I've been working
with a solid team, and we're all riding out the startup thing together. My main
role as of late has been "Gamebuilding", which is designing and constructing the
sub-games, cinematic sequences, and character interactions. Prior to that, I was
doing a whole lot of tool development and backend systems construction. Maybe
the most important thing I found out about myself over the course of the project
so far is how much I love building tools.

I've been finding it difficult to find time to work on other projects, but have
been poking away at things here and there when possible.
