Hi there, I'm Rob Butler and this is my site. This is mostly just a test post, so here's a little about myself. I like:

+ Loud Amps
+ C#
+ The Road Warrior
+ Unity
+ William Gibson
+ Discharge
+ Burritos
+ Black Clothes
+ Bikes
+ Starcraft

I work as a Software Engineer at Orpheus Interactive in Halifax, NS. I spend my time there making neat things like core systems, gameplay sequences,
graphics, and effects. That pretty accurately describes how I spend a lot of my free time, but when I'm not doing that, I'm playing in
bands in cities around North America. I also enjoy getting immersed in other worlds through movies, TV, and reading SciFi.
Biking around my beautiful city and camping just outside it are also lots of fun, but I'd be lying if I tried to paint
myself as an outdoorsy type.

I've been working through a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science since 2010. As it's now 2014, that should probably mean that I've already
graduated, but I put courses on the backburner to jump on the opportunity to develop a great game with an amazing team at Orpheus.
I'm still planning on finishing my degree, but I'm managing the program by taking a substantially reduced courseload on top of working full
time. Doing that while playing in bands and being actively social has been quite hectic, but I'm into it.
