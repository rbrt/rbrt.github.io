I had a few recent posts about playing with Voronoi Diagrams lately in fullscreen
effects. The results were interesting, and pretty nonsensical. I'm at a point now
in my TOP SECRET project (Which I'll probably post about after GDC) where I need
to be transitioning between different gameplay scenes. I was thinking that one
neat method of doing this might be to utilize that Voronoi work a little bit.

I didn't get very far into doing that before winding up with this:

Which I thought looked kind of neat. It wasn't too hard to do; I'm just sampling
an RGB noise texture for my Voronoi points, and then colouring the cell with
whatever the noise texture's colour is at the nearest sample point. The source
looks like this:

And the result, which is pretty plain, looks like this:

But then I decided to add some sine waves, and to start trying to colour things
by their distance from the center of the cell. My implementation is naive (read: wrong)
but it produced this:

And then I thought, what about if we added more sines... and some cosines too?

Programming shaders is fun! Now maybe I'll come out of this with something to
actually use in my game...
