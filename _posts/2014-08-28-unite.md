First things first, I got my DK2 yesterday:

Second, I've been working on a beat 'em up when I can find time which is tentatively called
"PK". 5 points if you can figure out what it stands for. At this point I've just done some rough
animations, spent some time figuring out crowd behaviours, and written a loose framework
for enemy AI which is already proving to be poor at scaling. I want to use some of the learnings
I obtained during an AI talk at Unite to help manage this. Here's a gif of the current state of things:

Third, I went to Unite 2014 last week. It was my first time doing a conference, and it was a really
great experience. My main takeaway was a lot of new knowledge, but I also met a few new people and
got to see some friends I hadn't seen in awhile. The talks were mostly useful, and seemed to fall
on opposite sides of the Awesome<===>Weak spectrum without any falling anywhere in between.
There were some great chats on AI, Multiplatform Development, Editor Scripting and Tool Design,
Compilers and Code Generation, 2D tricks, and Physically Based Rendering. The good talks felt like
being in a university lecture, but while being totally engaged and coming out with immediately useful
knowledge. That experience occurred in university, of course, but was much less frequent.

It was really cool and exciting to see what's coming up in Unity 5.0, and to hear the features
planned out for beyond 5.0 in the roadmap talk. I also didn't take advantage of all of the engineers
they had available in between each talk, but knowing about that portion of the conference, I will
definitely be ready to take advantage of it next year. On that note, I'm definitely going next year.
Any doubts I had about the value of conferences were dispelled, and I've been motivated to make my
way out to GDC next year, and anything else that looks interesting, as a result.
