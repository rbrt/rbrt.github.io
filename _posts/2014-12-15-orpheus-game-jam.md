Today at the office we had an in house game jam for a day. The team produced
about 10 games in total, many of which were Christmas themed. It was a blast to
take the day and just make something on the office machines. It was also really
cool to see what everyone had come up with at the end of the day. I worked alone
and decided to continue getting mileage out of the rigged baby model I bought
for Catastrophe Jam. The result was Rabies Babies (jam theme was "two words
that rhyme"):

I need to stop making things with Unity 5 so that I can actually post playable
builds...
