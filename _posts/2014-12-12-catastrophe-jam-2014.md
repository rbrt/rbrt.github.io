The first (and only?) annual Catastrophe Jam is finishing up at Volta tonight.
The rough premise is that you have three hours to make a game, but beyond that,
there aren't really any rules. There would up being about 30 or 40 people taking
part, which was awesome. We saw a bunch of different submissions which varied
substantially in how far complete they were.

I made Babby's Quest. A third-person action adventure game. Here are two gifs
from it:

It was a ridiculous night.
