I've worked a bit more on the drifting game, and I now have a tentative title:

I've done a bit of menu work, created a system for recording and playing back
replays, created that title screen, added a system for detecting and scoring drifts,
added destructible objects, made the car explode when you fly off the road, and
added some first pass smoke effects.

For the menu, I took the approach of having multiple Canvases for different contexts
that are all managed by a top level object. This object can smoothly transition
between menus as the game goes from the title, to gameplay, to failure, and so on.
I made a utility component that will ensure that certain objects on a prefab are
always enabled when you apply changes to the prefab. This is useful on the menu
so that I can disable all of the other canvases to work on one at a time, and not
worry about accidentally saving disabled canvases. If I didn't take this approach,
this is what I would be working with:

For replays, I made a component that you can place on a car, and then it will
record the transform's position and rotation at every frame. It also records whether
or not the tires are smoking, and can be extended to record other necessary data
pretty easily. The data is stored in a ScriptableObject for now, but I'm going to
serialize it in a different manner if I wind up making an in-game record replay
feature. To play it back, a similar component is placed on a stripped down car
object, and then all of the recorded info is played back each frame. I used it to
make the title sequence at the top of this post.

For detecting drifts, I'm just looking at the direction the car is traveling and
comparing it against the car's forward vector. I'm combining this information with
the speed at which the car is traveling, and using it to provide a "drift intensity"
that is used to determine when effects like smoke and skid marks should be enabled,
and also what score multipliers to apply.
