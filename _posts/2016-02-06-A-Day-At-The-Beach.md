I started messing around with Unity's procedural skybox shader which is a lot
of fun. Changing the colour, shape, and movement of the sun has interesting
results. Also pictured are some birds and a tree I made in Blonder, the addition
of a chromakeyed swirl, hue shift, and palette swap to the Substandard Shader,
and some chromatic aberration.
