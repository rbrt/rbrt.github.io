I started messing around with Unity's procedural skybox shader which is a lot
of fun. Changing the colour, shape, and movement of the sun has interesting
results. Also pictured are some birds and a tree I made in Blonder, the addition
of a chromakeyed swirl, hue shift, and palette swap to the Substandard Shader,
and some chromatic aberration.

Keying the swirl lets me choose whether it should affect all, most, or none of
the screen, and using a noise texture to transition between effects gives an
uneven wipe between chaos and... less chaos. 

I brought back some water I implemented a year or so ago, and shaped some terrain
using curves to specify geometry in Blonder.
