I've banged out a few more features over the last week or so. The most significant
one is probably the ability to use a boost. Initially the boost worked MarioKart
style - as you drift, your boost becomes more powerful. When you exit the drift,
the boost kicks in. This seemed to work, but was kind of annoying to me. To confirm
that theory, I got a few  people to play the game at our monthly Halifax Game Collective
meetup. Almost everyone went off the track, so I decided to make it something that
is already activated.

Now, as you drift, a boost bar is filled up. Once you've accumulated boost, you
can choose to utilize it at will. This lets you try to correct a bad drift off
track, gain speed before a drift, keep momentum through a drift, etc.

I also added a lap timer, and some more drifting indications. You'll now see the
current drift's possible score, current distance, and possible boost. Colliding
into an object, or flying off the track will cancel everything you've accumulated
so far.
