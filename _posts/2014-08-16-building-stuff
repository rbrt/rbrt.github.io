One day into construction and I've got this page in a state I'm happy with. Now I can focus on making
more things to display here! I had some semblance of a page before that I had built with Python using
Django and Bootstrap, and was hosting on a droplet with DigitalOcean. Upon decided to move things
over to Github Pages, I decided to scrap what I had an mostly start again. This page is built with Jekyll
on top of one of the provided themes. I modified a few things and have written a bit of my own CSS, but the
rapid development of this page is in no small part due to the scaffolding provided by Github.

Using Jekyll's templating features feels quite similar to Django's templates, and I'm glad to not
have to forego those features as a result of moving away from Django. The power of handling everything
behind the scenes with Python scripting is undeniable, but I also don't really need any of that for
a project like this page. The built-in blog support of Jekyll is great too, and while there are freely
available packages for the Python Django stack that make blogging easy, I'm finding this way of doing
things to be pretty effortless.
