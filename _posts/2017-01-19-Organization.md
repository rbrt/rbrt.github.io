For awhile now, I've been using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for personal projects to help me stay
organized. I find that using anything is beneficial to help stay on track, as
it's really easy otherwise to forget about something you noticed, or just not be
sure what to do next after completing a task. I used to keep lists, and at work
we use JIRA, but lists get really messy and JIRA is just overkill. Trello really
doesn't scale well. At my last job we used it and it became very easy to lose track
of issues and it's tedious to group tasks for sprints. However, for personal
projects, it's great.

I set up different columns for each category of task that I can think of, and I
keep a "DONE" pile at the very beginning of my board. Keeping that list of
finished cards is a nice reminder of what's been done lately, and it just feels
good to move tasks over there as they're completed.

Beyond just keeping track of what needs to be done, I find it really useful to
be able to leave notes to myself for things to try. If I'm in the middle of
something and notice a gameplay tweak or art change that's unrelated to what I'm
doing, it's nice to be able to leave a quick note to myself in the relevant column
so I can remember to look into it later.

I also really like being able to attach images to cards, because I have a whiteboard
in my office at home, and I find this is a really nice way to keep whatever I draw
there organized and archived. Then I can clear my whiteboard without having to worry
about erasing something important.
