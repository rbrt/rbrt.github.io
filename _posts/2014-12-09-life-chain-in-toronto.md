So a few weekends ago we went and played Not Dead Yet 2014 in Toronto. It's the third
(?) iteration of the festival and we played last year as well. It takes place all
over the Downtown area in about 10 venues across 4 days. It was an insane weekend
and, as most big festivals are, a chance to see lots of tour friends from around
the world. I saw some people from the West coast that I hadn't seen in 2 or 3 years
and that was wonderful. We made and unloaded a bunch of merch, which these dudes
sold for us:

Playing was a lot of fun, but even better was the chance to catch some incredible
sets. <a href="http://institute.bandcamp.com/">Institute</a> from Texas have
been my favorite band of the year, with the Salt EP being my favorite record of
the year by far. They did not fail to hold up to expectations live either, it was
so so so good. The other really killer set of the weekend was DiE from the UK:

They also held up to their recordings, though I caught them in New York in April
so already knew what to expect. My friend Ben broke his rib during their set,
though that was pretty much his own fault.

We stayed in an AirBnB in Kensington market which was huge, nice, cheap, and
close to everything. I've stayed in AirBnBs in New York, Seattle, and Toronto and
they've all been awesome. Down with hotels, up with AirBnBs. I was disappointed to
not score many records while in Toronto except for a few 7"s, but all in all it was
a great weekend and a nice getaway.
